# Welcome to the FPGC4 Wiki!

On this page, you will find a brief introduction of this project. For (many) more details, use the navigation in the left menu.

## What it is
The FPGC4 (Field Programmable Game Console v4) is my big hobby project, built around a completely self designed SoC (System on a Chip), implemented on an FPGA.

Originally, the goal of this project, which started in 2017, was to design completely from the ground up a simple game console for an FPGA (hence the name FPGC). Eventually this idea shifted more towards creating an entire PC with the capabilities of a game console. 

To give you a general idea: The FPGC4 is kind of a Raspberry Pi, but with the performance of a Commodore 64, the graphics of a NES, and some "less retro" features like USB host, Ethernet, 32MiB SDRAM and a 32 bit architecture.

To keep the complexity of the project low, most features of the FPGC4 are very retro, like tile and sprite based rendering, RGBs video signals for CRT TVs (using RGB SCART, though VGA 240p is also supported), PS/2 Keyboard and SNES controller support. However, some more modern features were also added, like a 32 bit architecture, 32MiB SDRAM, USB host support (through a CH376T controller) and Ethernet (using a W5500).

The main components of the FPGC4 are a self designed 32 bit CPU, a self designed GPU (tile/sprite based), and a self designed Memory Unit, handling many different types of memory and I/O. Now there is also an external APU, using an ESP32 with I2S DAC as software synthesizer, connected over UART.

Aside from the hardware, this project also contains other software projects built for the FPGC4, like an assembler, C compiler, software libraries, programmer, software synthesizer for APU, MIDI converter and example code.

For this project I also designed an I/O board PCB.

## What it can do
Basically, the FPGC4 can run code, output video, output audio, and can interact with certain peripherals using for example GPIO, SPI or UART. It also has a USB host port for mass storage, a PS/2 port for a keyboard, a SNES controller port for a SNES controller and a Ethernet port for networking. It has 32MiB SDRAM and the program code is loaded from SPI flash or USB UART into SDRAM on boot. The board is powered from a single mini USB port, with UART capabilities for in-system programming.

As for performance, you should think of a computer from the 80's, but with 32MiB SDRAM, multiple gigabytes of mass storage using USB, and a 32 bit CPU (running at 25MHz). The GPU generates an RGBs video signal (for CRT TVs) and has a resolution of 320x240. Its performance is comparable to a NES (with more sprites). VGA can also be used, though it depends on your monitor if can actually handle a 240p 15KHz (horizontally) VGA signal correctly.

## Project hardware and software
The target FPGA is an Altera Cyclone IV EP4CE15. The development board used in this project is the [Cyclone IV EP4CE15 Core Board with 32MiB SDRAM from QMtech](https://www.aliexpress.com/i/32949281189.html).

This board is plugged into a self designed expansion PCB, which provides all I/O and power.

All hardware designs are written in Verilog. Iverilog and GTKwave are used to simulate these hardware designs before writing the design to the FPGA using Quartus Prime (Lite).

The Assembler, C compiler and most other scripts are written in Python 3. The assembler assembles a self designed assembly language, and the C compiler compiles C to this assembly language.

Sublime Text 3 is used as text editor/IDE, with some handy build scripts to speed up the development and to quickly send code to the FPGC4.
