# Specifications
These are the current specifications of the FPGC4:

- 25MHz CPU clock   
- 6.63MHz GPU clock
- 16MiB external SPI flash (QSPI with continous read mode) @ 25MHz. 32bit addresses. Used as ROM, but has option to switch to direct access where it is connected to an SPI bus in the Memory Unit.
- 32MiB SDRAM @ 25MHz. 32bit addresses. Readable and writable. Used as main memory
- ~16.4KiB VRAM (SRAM). Combination of 32, 9 and 8bit addresses (three seperate modules)
- 2KiB internal ROM for the Bootloader. 32bit addresses
- 4.125KiB Hardware Stack (SRAM). 32bit addresses
- 16 32bit registers, of which 15 are General Purpose
- 32bit instructions
- 27bit program counter for a possible address space of 0.5GiB at 32bit
- 320x240 video output (analog, RGBs) with 256 colors
- Optional (secondary) VGA output. Currently unused
- Two layers of 8x8 Tiles of which one layer has horizontal hardware scrolling support
- One Sprite layer with support for 64 Sprites. Max 16 Sprites per horizontal line (double the amount of the NES!)
- Memory mapped I/O
- Three One Shot (OS) timers
- SNES Controller support
- PS/2 Keyboard support
- UART and power over USB
- 8 GPI and 8 GPO pins (will become 8 GPIO pins after new PCB arrives)
- ESP32 as APU, connected via secondary UART port.
- 16bit I2S DAC for ESP32 APU
- USB host with FAT(12/16/32) file system support using a CH376T controller over SPI
- Ethernet using W5500 over SPI
- 8 interrupts, of which 4 normal interrupts (currently attached to two OS timers, UART RX and the frameDrawn signal of the FSX2), and 4 extended interrupts (currently attached to the PS/2 controller, a third OS timer and UART2 RX (ESP32 APU))
- <1W Power draw (without USB device plugged in), so can easily be powered by a single laptop USB port, and no heatsinks/cooling is required (update: now a bit more, since and ESP32 and W5500 has been added. Still no heat of course and easy to power). 

!!! info "TODO"
	When new PCB assembled, do final measurements on power
